- Temporarily disabled the validation layers to nsight can profile the shader.
Disabled the code base : 


#ifdef _DEBUG
constexpr bool enableValidationLayers = false;
#else
constexpr bool enableValidationLayers = false;
#endif


	const std::vector<const char*> validationLayers = {
		//"VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation",
		//"VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation"
	};

Also removed the env variables, can be restored by referencing the screen shot on the desktop.

- write deconstructor to quadTree class


- write shader for main animation

- shadow mapping

{
	Caveats and Considerations:
	Memory Usage: Storing full position data for each fragment can consume a significant amount of memory, especially at higher resolutions. This is something to consider when designing your G-buffer layout.

	Precision and Range: Be mindful of the precision and range when encoding position data, as insufficient precision can lead to artifacts in lighting calculations.

	Alternatives: Depending on your lighting calculations and the complexity of your scene, you might find alternative methods (like reconstructing position from depth) more efficient.
