{
	Caveats and Considerations:
	Memory Usage: Storing full position data for each fragment can consume a significant amount of memory, especially at higher resolutions. This is something to consider when designing your G-buffer layout.

	Precision and Range: Be mindful of the precision and range when encoding position data, as insufficient precision can lead to artifacts in lighting calculations.

	Alternatives: Depending on your lighting calculations and the complexity of your scene, you might find alternative methods (like reconstructing position from depth) more efficient.
